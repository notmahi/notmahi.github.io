<p class="f0-light">Hello, I am Mahi!</p>
<p>
    I am currently a <mark>ðŸŽ‰final-yearðŸŽ‰</mark> Computer Science Ph.D. student at <a
        href='https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html' target="_blank">NYU Courant</a> working with <a
        href="https://lerrelpinto.com" target="_blank">Prof.
        Lerrel Pinto</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I am focused on <mark>building generally intelligent robots that <em>just work</em> everywhere, out of the
        box.</mark>
    I research questions on the intersection of machine learning and robotics, primarily to understand the
    representation and data that will lead to, among others, home robots that can perform everyday tasks by learning
    both from humans and on their own.

<p>
    I am grateful for the <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/apple-scholars-aiml-2023"
        target="_blank">Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD fellowship</a> for supporting my research.
    Previously, I was a visiting scientist at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Fundamental AI Research
        (FAIR)</a> at Meta with <a href="https://imisra.github.io/" target="_blank">Ishan Misra</a>.

    <p>Right now, my research focuses on figure out how to get robots to work with us in a
        household settings. If you are not a robotics person, think of it this way: I plan to build robots that I can
        tell a robot to walk into an arbitrary home, and cook me <a

            target="_blank">khichuri</a>,
        and it can just cook it for me.</p>
    <p>In a previous life, I was at MIT, working on Robust Machine Learning with <a href="https://madry-lab.ml"
            target="_blank">Prof. Aleksander
            Madry</a>, where I got my Masters and Undergraduate degrees, and was a Silver medalist for Bangladesh at <a
            href="https://www.imo-official.org/country_hall.aspx?code=BGD&column=awards&order=desc&gender=hide&nameform=western"
            target="_blank">International Mathematical Olympiads</a>.</p>
    <p>Besides my graduate research, I keep busy doing a variety of different things. Just in 2020, I was helping
        Bangladesh
        with <a href="https://notmahi.github.io/bd-rt-dashboard/" target="_blank">COVID-19 data analytics</a> with their
        <a href="https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2020/06/03/ndatf-to-help-bangladesh-government-to-flag-covid-19-risk-zones"
            target="_blank">National
            Data Analytics Task Force</a>, and helping a university transition to online learning. Since then, I&#39;ve
        also helped out a friend&#39;s <a href="https://affinedefi.com/" target="_blank">startup</a> with some
        quantitative analytics. On
        my free time, I like reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13481789" target="_blank">books</a>,
        cooking, and visitingthe large trove of museums in New York.
